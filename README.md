  <p align="left">
    Resumeee is a web application that stores user's projects for easy finding.
    <br /><br />
    The top shows all the technologies used in all the stored projects. When the tag is selected, the projects with that technology will show up below.
    <br /><br />
    Each card holds a project with a project name and technology tags at the top, a project summary in the middle, and a drop-down icon at the bottom. When a user clicked on the drop-down icon, the bullet points for the project will show up.
    <br /><br />
    When the pen icon has clicked, the form for adding a new project to the web will show up below the collection of technology tags.
    <br /><br />
    All the project are stored in the local mongodb.
